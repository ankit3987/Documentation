### Architecture and installation of kubernetes

## why k8 is needed when docker act similar

1. single host nature
   1. it has only single host 
   
2. auto healing 
   1. it mean container will start automatic if there are 1000 of containers then how to monitor all of the container then k8 gives autohealing allways docker ps is not used in 1000 of containers
   2. it will start mannualy not automatically it will start
   3. tough to track 10,000 container

3. auto scaling 
   1. if there are docker installed in the server and  only one container in the server and now the maximum utilization of that contianer is 4gb ram 4cpu and sudenlly user incresed by 10000 to 1 lack then we have to creaate 10 container for accesive users so we can create it manually and configure each contianer with other container apart of this we can do load blancing so it is manually done by devops engineer
   
4. very simplistic level of docker 
   1. it does not solve the enterprises level supports
      1. like load balancing 
      2. firwall
      3. heal
      4. api gateways

## how k8 solve these problem solutions:
k8 install as a cluster:-
1. (single host)
   1. cluster ------> group of nodes -------> master/node

2. (auto scalling):- there are two autoscalling vertically(expand single container capacity) and horizontally (make extra containers)
   1. manually :- it has yaml file then we can edit that file with writing replicas:1 to 10
   2. atomatically :- HPA (horixzontal pod autoscaller) when container hit thresold of 80% then it will create next container
   
3. (auto healing):- it will control the damages, 
   1. for eg my container will go down ,so in case of docker i will check container by writing docker ps command and then i restart the conainer or build fresh contianer
   2. now in k8 will automatically start new container by (Api server), whenever api server reciving the server goes down it will rollout the a new container 

4. (enterprize level):- docker is not used in production level k8 not used in production level 

## k8s practices methods
**Online Platform for k8s**
1. kubernated palyground 
2. play with k8s
3. play wiht kubernated classroom
   
**Cloud based k8s service**
1. GKE -> google kubernates service 
2. AKS -> Azure kubernates service 
3. Amazon EKS -> Elastic kubernates service 

**kubernates installation Tool**
1. minicube 
2. kubeadm

## difrence between kubernates and docker swarm
**installation:-**
   1. kubernates:- complicated and time consuming
   2. docker swarm :- fast and easy
    
**support:-** 
   1. kubernates:- k8s can work with almost alll container type like rocket ,docker ,contianer 
   2. docker swarm :- work wiht docker only
    
**gui :-**
   1. kubernates:- gui available 
   2. docker swarm :- not available 
   
**data volumes :-** 
   1. kubernates: only shared with containers in same pod
   2. docker swarm :- can be shared with any other container
   
**updates & rollback :-** 
   1. kubernates:- process schdulling to maintain services while updating
   2. docker swarm :- progrsive updates and service health monitering throughout the update 

**autoscalling :-** 
   1. kubernates:- support verticle and horizontal autoscalling
   2. docker swarm :- not support autoscaling

**logging and monitoring :-**
   1. kubernates:- inbuilt tool presenting monitoring
   2. docker swarm :- used 3rd party tools like spllunk
   


## k8s architecture 

**cluster → node → pod → container → microserice/application**

**Pod - A Kubernetes pod is a collection of one or more containers, and is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application**
note:- u can create many container in one pod but only one is recomended and when one pod has only one container then if that container is down then pod will automatically goes down and we have to create new pod.

- **Control plane (master node)**
1. api server (exposes to external world) - core component of k8s, accepts all incoming  reqs, exposes k8s to external world.

2. etcd (key value store) - cluster related infos, Backup service.

3. scheduler(Scheduling pods or resources in K8s) - receives info from api server & acts on it

4. controller manager - ensures controllers like replica set are running,(Example: Replica Set)

5. cloud controller manager(ccm) - No need for on-premice, like terraform

- **Data plane (Worker Node) → 3 components:**
  
1. kubelet(Creating and managing  pod) - creates pod, ensures pod is always running

2. kube proxy(uses iptables in Linux machine) - provides networking like Docker0, default load balancing

3. container runtime(enviornment) - runs container inside pod

with extra detail:-
node (kubelet and container engine)
node is going to run 3important piece of software/process
**kublet:-**
- agent running on the node
- listen to kubernestes master(eg-pod creation request)
- use port 10255
- send sucess/fail report to master

**container engine (docker):-**
- works with kubelet
- pulling images
- start/stop coontainer
- exposing container on port specified in manifest

**kuber-proxy:-**
- assign ip to each pod
- it is required to assign ip address to pods(dynamic)
- kube-proxy run on each node & this make sure that each pod will get its own unique ip address 
  


## Working wth kubernestes
- we create manifest(.yml)
- apply this to cluster (to master) to bring desired state
- pod run on node which is controlled by master

**Role of master node**
kubernetes cluster contains running or bare metal/VM instance /cloud instance/all mix

- kubernetes designates one or more of these as master and all other as workers
- the mater is now going to run set of k8s processes these process will ensure smooth functioning of cluster these processes are called "control plane"
- can be multi-master for high availabilty
- master run control plane to run cluster smoothly

**higher level kubernetes object**
- Replication set :- auto scalling and auto healing 
- Deployment :- versioning and rollback
- Service :- static IP and networking
- Volume :- Non-epheneral storage (local store data permanent)

**Important**
kubectl → single cloud 
kubeadm → on premise
kubefed → federated (on premise + cloud)

## Install kubectl and minikube on linux on local machine

**Install docker**
- `sudo apt update `
- `sudo apt install docker.io`

- echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
- sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
- kubectl version --client

**Install minikube**
- curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
- sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube && rm minikube-linux-amd64
